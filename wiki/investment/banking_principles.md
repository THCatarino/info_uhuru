# Banking Principles

We will not accept investment instruments which work based on loans.

90% of our cash reserves are put in gold or hardware deals which are interesting to the future (e.g. lot of cheap harddisks, lot of server chassis, ...).

Less than 10% is kept on banks and we are looking for safe reliable banks.
